This is for people who want to an option to "add new folders"(with those folders not being called folders cause they'll have different icons &amp; serve as, well, simple project-viewing &amp; seperating directories, as a typical parent directory does, don't get me wrong - I just wish to make a better distinction between directories) 2windows rclick menu(s)

NOTE: This is an IDEA of mine, more so than an actual working prototype. Not an actual thing at the moment(go look elsewhere for an actual thing) cause I suck at programming, and this is consequently, kinda sloppy and I really cannot remember what it does.
